                Welcome to my cyberspace. I am K, a chemistry student who hates chemistry (: I live in India and I created this site by getting inspired from <a href="https://wiby.org/">wiby.org</a>'s "surprise me" feature and <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities</a>. This website is my step to become a <a href="https://landchad.net/">landchad</a>. My English is not that good so kindly ignore the grammar mistakes.

                I like to watch anime, movies and tv in my free time. Currently I am watching Jujutsu Kaisen and I can say that it's the best anime I have watched after Attack on Titan. I also watch old episodes of Taarak Mehta ka Ooltah Chashmah (Hindi Tv serial). I play badminton in the evening, I play solo as I like to control the court on my own. Apart from this I like to learn about Free and Open Source Movement and Software.
